To compile;
gcc -Wall asn1.c libpnm.c -o asn1 -lm

Not good practice, but;
1. Program 1 is finished
2. Program 2 is finished
3. Program 3, I got stuck with and it was 2l8 in the week 4me

My current submission includes;
1. Images for program 1
2. Images for program 2
3. Report on both programs
4. A Make File (just type make)
